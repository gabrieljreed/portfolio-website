Welcome to my blog! I'll be sharing insights and stories from my journey as a pipeline technical director and software developer.

Let's kick things off by talking about something close to my heart: daily creativity. It's amazing what a little consistency can do for your creative spirit.

In my "Giraffe-a-Day" project, I learned that even on the toughest days, when inspiration seemed elusive and time was short, showing up and creating something was a game-changer. It's like a daily exercise for your creative muscles.

Whether you're an artist, developer, or anything in between, I invite you to join me on this exploration of creativity, discipline, and the beauty of sticking with something even when it feels challenging.

Stay tuned for more stories, insights, and maybe a few more [giraffes](/projects/yearofthegiraffe) along the way!
