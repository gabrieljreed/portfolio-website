In mid-2021, I watched struthless' video [The drawing advice that changed my life](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6NsEDwHHiE). As someone who has enjoyed drawing and doodling for years, I (rather impulsively) decided to do the same challenge. My roommates and I had a giraffe magnet on our fridge, and I thought they were silly looking animals that could be fun to draw, and thus started the Year of the Giraffe. While this project may seem unrelated to my technical expertise, it profoundly impacted my approach to problem-solving and the creative process.

### Exercising Creativity

I quickly discovered that my creative well could run dry, as within a couple months, I had drawn every giraffe I could think of. I was determined to find fresh ideas for each day, experimenting with different styles, expressions, and perspectives. This challenge forced me to dig deep, pushing the boundaries of my imagination and reminding me that creativity is a muscle that can be exercised and strengthened.

### Mastery of Tools

Getting started, I selected Procreate as my digital canvas, and through consistent practice, it became second nature to me. Along the way, I stumbled upon valuable techniques and shortcuts that enriched my creative work and allowed me to work much faster. The experience taught me the importance of commitment to a single tool, rather than constantly switching, and how this dedication can lead to mastery.

### Embracing Imperfection

My _Year of the Giraffe_ taught me the art of acceptance and imperfection. The daily deadline demanded that I become comfortable with the concept of "good enough." It pushed me to release work that wasn't perfect, to be unafraid of discovering mistakes post-publication, and to understand that not every creation needs to be a masterpiece.

### Daily Dedication

The project instilled in me the importance of showing up every day, regardless of external factors. Some days, inspiration flowed effortlessly, while on others, I faced creative droughts. But I persisted. This daily dedication transformed my approach, proving that consistency breeds growth, even in the face of adversity.

### Overcoming Resistance

There were moments when the blank canvas seemed daunting, and procrastination beckoned. However, the discipline I cultivated pushed me past resistance. I learned that starting, even with reluctance, was often the hardest part. Once I began, creativity would often follow, and I would create something I was proud of.
